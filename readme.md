SUPER LEGO PLACE-O-SEARCH

For the Thinkful CapStone midterm project, I made a site that searches
the rebrickable database and google's API for lego sets made after real world locations.  

The gist of this site is this; users will search for a location and get either the corresponding lego set and a static google maps image of that location, or a responsive grid of google images corresponding to their search query.  Because their aren't many premade sets/landmarks, the google image search seems more common at this point, and I might add more functionality going forward.

TECHNOLOGIES:
The site uses html/CSS with Jquery, and it references Google Static Maps API, Google Custom search API and the Rebrickable API database. Icons by IonIcons.

UI/UX:
The site has a lot of simple jquery animation/transition elements, lots of CSS/HTML, nothing
super fancy, but their a method that makes divs based on responsiveness, so an issue I had earlier
was exceeding my search quota with google because I tried to remake the image grids everytime a
user resized the window (lesson learned)
